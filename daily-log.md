# 101 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 17: May 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built a Patatap clone which involved using new libraries (paper.js and howler.js) Since that was the end of the front-end part of "The Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy I figured it was time to get a lot of practice in before moving onto any back-end. I started the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) which seems very interesting and I really like that it is all in vanilla JS, and CSS. I built the drumkit and did my best to rebuild the HTML and CSS first by looking at the page. After that, I watched the video through and then tried to build it. 

**Thoughts**: The Patatap clone was interesting and a little confusing at first. Reading documentation is obviously a very important skill that will take a while to get used to. In the end it all made sense and I understand all of the code. During the Drumkit exercise I realized I really have a long ways to go on learning all of CSS. knowing the right CSS properties to use is a daily battle, but I am learning more of them everyday. During the firs watchthrough of the JS video there were a few new things, especially the data- element and how he selected the data- element with querySelector using back tics and ${} which ended up looking like `const audio	= document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`)`. I was able to figure out about 50% of the code and had to follow along for the other 50%. Learned a lot about CSS transform. All in all it was fun and as a drummer it was a very fun build.

### Day 16: May 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through jQuery and learned the basic syntax and some of the most common methods. Compared the vanilla JS way vs jQuery. Everything that can be done in jQuery can be done with JS. Focused on selecting and manipulating, then reviewed events. Worked through a Todo List project using jQuery

**Thoughts**: jQuery is pretty useful, though it's hard to tell how useful it still is in todays marketplace. It can't hurt to learn it though! The To-Do app was pretty easy to make. Again, I would wait until Cody mentioned what the task was we were going to complete, then go write my own code first before the follow along.

### Day 15: May 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built a RGB color guessing game with a follow along video. 

**Thoughts**: While I don't think I would have been able to build it from scratch on my own, I am pretty happy with my ability to understand the reasoning behind what the instructor was doing. Once he explained how we would be acomplishing a task, I was able to write the code.

### Day 14: May 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more DOM manipulation and did lots of practice

**Thoughts**: DOM manipulation is definitely what makes JS fun!

### Missed Two Days
Out of town with no service or access to computer over the weekend. 

### Day 11: May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a lot of DOM manipulation. Learning how to select different parts and change style, text and attributes. 

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty sweet. Learned a lot about manipulating the DOM. I have spend quite a bit of time learning the fundamentals of JS and it is nice to finally start using it to create and change things on web page. Don't get me wrong, reversing a string and capitolizing the first letter of each word is just fantastic, but creating visible results feels a bit more meaningful.

### Day 10: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JS day! Spent most of the day reviewing JS that I have already learned pretty well. Glad I already have a good grasp on it though, because they rush through a lot of concepts and I would have been pretty lost if this was my first time learning about JS.

**Thoughts**: I will write pseudocode, I will write pseudocode, I will write pseudocode, I will write pseudocode! One thing I am picking up from this course and wish I would get drilled into my brain is to write more pseudocode!

**Learned**: Built a basic todo app which was surprisingly easy

### Day 9: May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more advanced HTML and CSS and Bootstrap. Built more complex pages including a full web landing page with navbar, a better looking photo portfolio with navbar. Both projects were mobile friendly and could be resized. Also built a guessing game where a random number is generated and while you guess it tells you if your guess is too high or too low. We are now into the intro JS part through the Web Developer Bootcamp series which will mostly just be review as I feel I have a decent grasp on the JS basics. 

**Thoughts**: Again, we are building more things which is very fun. I am starting to get better at looking up documntation or answer to questions I have when running into issues. I think it will be quite important to get good at this as it sounds like it's a common occurance.

 ### Day 8: May 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on CSS and into more Bootstrap. Built a few basic pages with just HTML and CSS that don't do anything including a blog page and a photo portfolio. 

**Thoughts**: Learning HTML and CSS is a lot more fun than JS was so far because of the ability to start building things. The idea of building software and web pages is what got me interested in coding, so it is fun to see that starting to become more of the learning process.

### Day 7: May 7, 2018

**Missed days**: I wasn't able to code on either day this weekend due to a wedding and family/friends visiting from out of town. While I am dedicated to this goal, there are some things that take precedence. I decided to keep the day # relative to the number of days since starting the journey and not total number of days coding. That way I can get a better understanding of how much I learn in the full 101 days. 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to combine working through the FCC site with the Web Developer Bootcamp by Cody on Udemy. I tend to learn better from videos than from reading so it will be nice to have in addition to FCC. Today will be focused more on HTML and CSS again similar to day 4. 

**Thoughts**: Again, HTML and CSS are quite a bit easier than JS so I am glad I already put in some decent time learning JS. My biggest issue with HTML and CSS currently is organizing the page and getting things to appear where I want them to. Bootstrap makes this decently easy, but I'm trying to avoid bootstrap while learning CSS. 

**Learned**:
* Intermediate HTML - tables, forms, etc. 
* Worked through more CSS

### Day 4: May 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Front End FCC sections to start using what I've learned with JS. 

**Thoughts**: May the 4th be with you! HTML and CSS are a lot easier than JS and I'm happy I started learning JS first. It is making these sections fly by. 

**Learned:**
* CSS and HTML basics. 
* Bootstrap and jQuery
* Built my tribute page

### Day 3: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through a lot of practice problems and trying to learn more built in objects. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling like I understand the basics of the JS language, but am terrible at using it to actually solve problems. 

**Learned** 
* `array.reduce` - reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue) {  }, initialValue); *you don't need an initialValue*
```js
let array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
array.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
});
```
* `in` operator - returns true if the specified property is in the object (or index is in the array)
 ```js
 let myCar = {make: 'Mazda', model: 'Maxda 3', year: 2013};
 console.log('make' in myCar);
 // expected output: true
 ```
 * `.map` vs `.forEach` - `.map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array while `forEach` performs a provided function once for each array index.
 ```js
 let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
 //.forEach changes the original array
 arr.forEach((arrValue, index) => {
   return arr[index] = arrValue * 2;
 });
 
 //original array is change: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 
 //.map creates a new array with the changes made
 let arr2 = arr.map(arrValue => {
   return arrValue * 2;
 });
 
 //new array is change: arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 ```
 * `array.filter()` is a method that creates a new array with all elements(index) that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
 ```js
const words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

let result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);

// expected result: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]
 ```
 * `array.sort()` sorts an array alphabetically or takes a function to sort numerically from smallest to largest 
 ```js
var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
 ```
 * `array.reverse()` reverses an array.
 * reversed a string using `.split()`, `.reverse()`, `.join()`
 * factorialize a number using recursion, for loop and while loop. 
 * Regular Expressions are pretty crazy. Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings
 * Had to use regular expressions to check for palindromes in a string along with `.replace()`, `.toLowerCase()`,  `.split()`, `.reverse()`, `.join()`

### Day 2: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Reread through the 2nd chapter of YDKJS: Up & Going again. Spent a bit more time on closure, `this`, and prototypes. 
* Working slowly through YDKJS: Scope and Closure. 
* Chapter One notes: Already understood pretty well how scope worked, but learned about the RHS and LHS look-ups in scope and learned about how the compilation of the code works. 

**Thoughts**: Trying to slow down and focus more on each subject. Got introduced to the `call` function which allows you to use a method from a different object.

### Day 1: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Watch and Code - PJS walkthrough building a to-do list app.
* Completed Project Euler: Multiples of 3 and 5, Even Fibonacci numbers 

**Thoughts:** I definitely enjoyed the lessons and am happy I'm understanding all of the code being written. Most of it I could
figure out what was going to be written before he wrote it. I am also starting to get better at understanding and reading 
objects and arrays. 

**Learned:** 
* More in depth understanding of `this`
* Review of higher-order functions and callback functions 
* onclick HTML 
* `forEach` which takes an array and does an action for every item in the array, removing the need of `for` loops. 
* Basic understanding of how to connect JS to HTML and have them work together. Learned about event listeners, append child, element clicked, etc.
