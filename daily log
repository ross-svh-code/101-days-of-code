# 101 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Watch and Code - PJS walkthrough building a to-do list app.

**Thoughts:** I definitely enjoyed the lessons and am happy I'm understanding all of the code being written. Most of it I could
figure out what was going to be written before he wrote it. I am also starting to get better at understanding and reading 
objects and arrays. 

**Learned:** 
* More in depth understanding of `this`
* Review of higher-order functions and callback functions 
* onclick HTML 
* `forEach` which takes an array and does an action for every item in the array, removing the need of `for` loops. 
* Basic understanding of how to connect JS to HTML and have them work together. Learned about event listeners, append child, element clicked, etc.
